    "### **Abstraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It focuses on **hiding implementation details** and showing only the essential features of an object to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, abstraction allows you to define a blueprint or a general structure without worrying about how the specific functionality is implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Features of Abstraction**\n",
    "1. **Hiding Complexity**:\n",
    "   - Users interact with the system without needing to understand the internal implementation.\n",
    "   - Example: When you drive a car, you only need to know how to operate the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake. You don’t need to know how the engine works.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Providing Simplicity**:\n",
    "   - Abstraction simplifies complex systems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Promoting Reusability**:\n",
    "   - Abstract classes and methods can be reused across multiple implementations, making your code more modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ensuring Focus on What’s Important**:\n",
    "   - It ensures that users focus on the **what** (functionality) rather than the **how** (implementation).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Abstraction in Python**\n",
    "In Python, abstraction is implemented using:\n",
    "1. **Abstract Classes**: Defined using the `ABC` (Abstract Base Class) module.\n",
    "2. **Abstract Methods**: Defined using the `@abstractmethod` decorator. These methods have no implementation in the abstract class and must be implemented in subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "Here’s a simple example of abstraction using abstract classes and methods:\n",
